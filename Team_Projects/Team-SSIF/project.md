Category IV: The Public-Private Jobs Nexus

Public-sector pull vs. private-sector productivity: how will public-sector labor markets shape private-sector skills and employment?

## Project Description

Team SSSIF selected a diverse group of eight countries representing different income levels—lower-income (Mozambique, Nepal), lower-middle income (Bangladesh, India), upper-middle income (Brazil, China), and high-income (Germany, USA). This cross-income sample allows the tool to compare GDP-per-capita contexts and examine how economic development shapes labor-market outcomes.

Within these countries, the application analyzes key labor indicators across both the public and private sectors. Users can explore variations in salaries, total employment counts, and workforce skill levels, gaining a clearer view of how these factors differ by sector and by national income group.
